## 🎯 My Objective
I am an engineering-focused SDET dedicated to building **resilient, observable, and scalable** quality systems. My goal is to bridge the gap between Development and Operations by implementing **TestOps** principles—moving beyond functional scripts into performance engineering, chaos testing, and deep-stack observability.

## 🛠️ Technical Arsenal
- **Languages:** C# (.NET), Java, TypeScript, Python
- **Automation:** RestSharp (API), Playwright (UI), NUnit, PactNET (Contract Testing), Postman/Newman
- **Performance & Scalability:** k6, JMeter, Stress & Soak testing
- **Observability:** Prometheus, Grafana, Mimir, Loki (The "LMP" stack)
- **Infrastructure:** Docker, Kubernetes (Ephemeral environments), AWS
- **Resilience:** Chaos Engineering (Gremlin, Chaos Mesh)

## 🧪 Current Focus & Projects
- **[[API Test Framework](https://github.com/aTapHub/atp.ApiAutomation.Portfolio)]:** A high-performance C#/.NET API Test framework utilizing parallel execution and coding best practices (api factory, dependency injection).
- **[[Observability Stack](https://github.com/aTapHub/atp.Observability.Project)]:** Implementing a monitoring system using metrics exporters / Prometheus / login / traces to correlate performance test (k6) metrics with infrastructure health.
- **AI model testing:** Using the student (local model under test -- llama) and judge ("smarter", api called model, LLM-as-a-judge) system in order to verify the quality of the answers returned bu the AUT model.
- **AI council:** Create 4 independent AI agents (senior SDET, senior Product Manager, senior Devops engineer, senior Dev engineer) that give feedback on qa/software topics.
- **System Design:** Currently deep-diving into distributed systems and data-intensive applications (as described in Alex Xu & Martin Kleppmann books).

## 📈 My Philosophy: "Quality at Scale"
I believe that in a modern microservices architecture, quality is measured by **resilience**. I don't just test if it works; I test how it fails. My current roadmap involves mastering:
- **Chaos Engineering:** Inducing faults to validate system recovery.
- **Contract Testing:** Ensuring service integrity in distributed environments.
- **Security Testing:** Integrating OWASP Top 10 automated checks into CI/CD.
